## Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
          
-  Tor's encryption remains unbroken, even the NSA cannot crack Tor's anonymity protection
-  Most successful attacks target browser vulnerabilities or user mistakes instead of breaking Tor's cryptographic design
-  Traffic correlation attacks are a concern when adversaries are able to monitor both ends of a connection
-  Tor serves legitimate users, not just criminals (such as activists avoiding censorship, military personnel for secure communication, families protecting childrens privacy, journalists researching sensitive topics)
-  Criminals have better tools available available than Tor for illegal activities (such as botnets and stolen devices)
-  No backdoors exist despite being funded by the US government
-  The open-source code has been audited by independent cryptographers
-  Running a TOR relay is legal in the US (no known prosecutions so far)
-  Software is user-friendly, requiring only a simple donload of the TOR browser bundle
-  TOR runs slower than regular internet but has improved significantly over time, speed increases thanks to volunteer-operated relays
-  Using TOR is not foolproof, users can still compromise their anonymity through poor security practices (such as logging into personal accounts or using outdated software)


## Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".

-  TOR is an anonymous internet browser that hides your real IP address by routing traffic through multiple encrypted relays
-  Originally developed by the US government in 2002, it is now maintained by volunteers worldwide
-  Simple to download and use (takes + or - 10 minutes to set up with minimal technical knowledge)
-  User internet traffic gets wrapped in multiple layers of encryption (like an onion)
-  Data passes through random relays points (entry/guard node, middle node, exit node)
-  Each relay knows the previous and next step, not the full path from you to your destination
-  Final exit node connects to your target website without encryption
-  More than 6,000 relay nodes operated by volunteers globally
-  Circuits change every 10 minutes to maintain security
-  The network has over 750,000 daily users worldwide
-  Legitimate uses include whistleblowers, journalists, activists, business protecting communications, users avoiding censorship
-  Ciminal uses include users wanting anyonymous communication for illegal activities (law enforcement actively work to track such usage)
-  Tracking TOR users requires significant resources and specialized techniques (most effective methods involves finding user mistakes rather than breaking the encryption)
