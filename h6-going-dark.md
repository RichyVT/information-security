## Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor
          
-  Tor's encryption remains unbroken, even the NSA cannot crack Tor's anonymity protection
-  Most successful attacks target browser vulnerabilities or user mistakes instead of breaking Tor's cryptographic design
-  Traffic correlation attacks are a concern when adversaries are able to monitor both ends of a connection
-  Tor serves legitimate users, not just criminals (such as activists avoiding censorship, military personnel for secure communication, families protecting childrens privacy, journalists researching sensitive topics)
-  Criminals have better tools available available than Tor for illegal activities (such as botnets and stolen devices)
-  No backdoors exist despite being funded by the US government
-  The open-source code has been audited by independent cryptographers
-  Running a TOR relay is legal in the US (no known prosecutions so far)
-  Software is user-friendly, requiring only a simple donload of the TOR browser bundle
-  TOR runs slower than regular internet but has improved significantly over time, speed increases thanks to volunteer-operated relays
-  Using TOR is not foolproof, users can still compromise their anonymity through poor security practices (such as logging into personal accounts or using outdated software)
